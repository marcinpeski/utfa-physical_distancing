MAT,Introduction to Proofs,MAT138H1-F,"The goal of this course is for students to become comfortable with abstraction, rigour, logic, and proofs. They will practice reading and understanding mathematical statements, analyzing definitions and properties, formulating conjectures and generalizations, providing and writing reasonable and precise arguments, writing and critiquing proofs. The instructor may use specific mathematical content, which could vary from year to year, to practice these skills. The course is aimed at students interested in the creative character of mathematics, particularly those planning to take any of our proof-oriented courses, and is an excellent preparation for MAT137Y1, MAT157Y1, or MAT240H1.","Note: students may take this course concurrently with MAT157Y1 or MAT137Y1, or prior to registering in MAT157Y1 or MAT137Y1.

MAT,K-Theory and C* Algebras,MAT437H1-S,"The theory of operator algebras was begun by John von Neumann eighty years ago. In one of the most important innovations of this theory, von Neumann and Murray introduced a notion of equivalence of projections in a self-adjoint algebra (*-algebra) of Hilbert space operators that was compatible with addition of orthogonal projections (also in matrix algebras over the algebra); and so gave rise to an abelian semigroup, now referred to as the Murray-von Neumann semigroup.","Later, Grothendieck in geometry, Atiyah and Hirzebruch in topology, and Serre in the setting of arbitrary rings (pertinent for instance for number theory); considered similar constructions. The enveloping group of the semigroup considered in each of these settings is now referred to as the K-group (Grothendieck's terminology); or as the Grothendieck group.",Prerequisite:,"Among the many indications of the depth of this construction was the discovery of Atiyah and Hirzebruch that Bott periodicity could be expressed in a simple way using the K-group. Also, Atiyah and Singer famously showed that K-theory was important in connection with the Fredholm index. Partly because of these developments, K-theory very soon became important again in the theory of operator algebras. (And in turn, operator algebras became increasingly important in other branches of mathematics.)",Recommended Preparation:,"The purpose of this course is to give a general, elementary, introduction to the ideas of K-theory in the operator algebra context. (Very briefly, K-theory generalizes the notion of dimension of a vector space.)",Distribution Requirement:,"The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically); and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory).",Breadth Requirement:,LEC0101,Monday,—,14:00,15:00,Wednesday,—,14:00,15:00,Friday,—,14:00,15:00,TF 203,https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494581,TF 203,https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494581,TF 203,,https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494581,,,"Elliott, G.",,of  available,0,20,Yes: 6 students,In Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Room,,,,,
