Upon completion of this class, students will (1) have overview knowledge of aspects of infancy as it relates to perception, cognition and behavior; (2) be able to use exploratory writing to develop arguments and develop their understanding of subject matter; and (3) begin to be able to read and summarize a scientific research paper in Developmental Psychology.

We will focus empirically on the rise of radical reformist Islam and evangelical Christianity, the two most dramatically successful forms of religiosity around the world today. We will study the implications for the foreign policies of key nation-states, as well as the forces that have contributed to the prevalence of contestatory religious politics and networks as new and poorly understood global actors. International religious freedom, human rights, the role of media and mediation, the place of religious or theological doctrines or imaginaries in constructing and motivating a range of political goals, many involving the use of violence. We will focus as well on the global spread of extremist forms of religious politics, conspiracy thinking, new online communities that lead to dangerous political outcomes, such as ‘QAnon’ and ‘Plandemic’. Many of the cases will focus on the non-Western world, especially the Middle East and Africa.",Prerequisite:,0.5 POL 200-level credit/0.5 RLG 200-level credit/1.0 HIS 200-level credit/1.0 PHL 200-level credit/1.0 SOC 200-level credit,Exclusion:,JPR364Y1,Distribution Requirement:,Social Science,Breadth Requirement:,Room,LEC0101,Monday,,"Marshall, R.",of  available,0,70,Yes: 9 students,In Person (See Delivery Instructions.),Priority (P),Enrolment Controls:,"Priority enrolment is given to the groups of students listed below until July 28.

RLG,Ghosts to Ancestors: Racialized Hauntings and Reparative Promise in Psychoanalysis,RLG419H1-S,,,,Course Description:,"All forms of injustice disfigure both societies and psyches. Racist, sexist, and other unconscious fantasies of evil and persecuting ‘others’ generate social injustice. At the same time, social injustice distorts the mind. This “dual track” process can drive human beings and their societies mad. Justice depends upon transformations of social structures and moral codes as well as changes within human minds. In order for psychoanalysis to realize its own potential for facilitating justice, it must confront its own historical contribution to injustice. Through a close reading of selected texts from Sigmund Freud and the activist psychiatrist Franz Fanon, this course explores the inherent tensions between colonizing and emancipatory themes within psychoanalytic discourses. Both Freud and Fanon contribute to a psychoanalytic critical theory that have influenced several contemporary ethnographic writers who explore the intricate ways in which social and cultural realities are internalized as unconscious hauntings and tormenting spirits across generations.",RLG211H1/RLG301H1/RLG302H1,Recommended Preparation:,Humanities,Distribution Requirement:,"Thought, Belief and Behaviour (2)",Breadth Requirement:,,,Room,LEC0101,Tuesday,,"Hewitt, M.",of  available,4,10,Yes: 0 student,In Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IN 209,—,14:00,16:00,https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494541

Freud’s psychoanalytic theories are widely (mis)interpreted in the register of a crude pansexualism and biological determinism. Adorno’s critique of society and the individual is often (mis)interpreted as so ruthlessly pervasive that it forecloses on any possibility for emancipatory transformation. This is a distorted view of both thinkers, that misses the hopeful, utopian currents that motivate and shape psychoanalysis and critical theory.
