We will investigate various major strands of loss. These tend to involve either personal loss or public loss, or perhaps both. Defeat in battle and loss of political office are examples of key areas where the public discourse of loss lingers. But the sack of a city meant the enslavement of the defeated and political failure can result in exile. The public stakes are also very personal. People can lose family members to war, disease or misfortune. What does one tell oneself or say to others at such a juncture? The lover can lose his or her beloved: again, what sorts of things get said at such moments?",Distribution Requirement:,"In short we will be examining moments where there is a potential crisis of identity whether civic or personal.
