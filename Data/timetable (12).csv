Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid densification and privatization bring additional pressures to bear on our conventional urban design models and understanding of urban public space, in both interior and exterior environments. In examining contested public space through the frame of monuments, public art and public actions, how may we begin to imagine new design models for flexible and resilient spaces? In facing an unknown future, how may public art inform design practices to support an open, social and welcoming urban environment? ***Students who took INI337H1S in the Summer 2021 Session (July to August) should not enrol in this course.***",,,ASMIN2207 MI URBAN STUDIES,ASSPE2207 SP URBAN STUDIES,,
