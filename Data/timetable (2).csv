We will also discuss how these discoveries can contribute to addressing global challenges, such as developing innovative biomaterials, enhancing food security and cultivating renewable biofuels.","BIO230H1/BIO255H1, BIO260H1/HMB265H1",Prerequisite:,BCH311H1/BIO251H1/CSB330H1/CSB340H1/CSB349H1/CSB350H1/MGY311Y1/MGY340H1,Recommended Preparation:,Science,Distribution Requirement:,Room,LEC0101,Wednesday,—,14:00,17:00,ES 3087,"McFarlane, H.",,8,30,Yes: 0 student,In Person,Priority (P),Enrolment Controls:,"Priority enrolment is given to the groups of students listed below until July 28.
